# Supabase Removal Summary

## Changes Made in This Session

1. Created a **localStorage-based API system** (`lib/local-api.ts`) to replace Supabase product and booking APIs:
   - Implemented `productsApi` with CRUD operations for products
   - Implemented `bookingsApi` with CRUD operations for bookings
   - Added data initialization for sample products

2. Fixed `auth_with_fallback_profile.js`:
   - Removed TypeScript annotations
   - Converted to work with localStorage instead of Supabase

3. Updated key pages to use the local API system:
   - `app/dashboard/page.tsx`: Now uses local products API
   - `app/collections/page.tsx`: Now uses local products API
   - `app/admin/inventory/page.tsx`: Now imports from local API
   - `app/dashboard/cart/page.tsx`: Now uses local API for cart and bookings

4. Added comprehensive instructions (`SUPABASE_CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) detailing:
   - Remaining issues to fix
   - How to update other admin pages
   - How to extend the API if needed
   - Final testing checklist

## Remaining Issues

1. **Admin Inventory Page** needs further fixes:
   - Missing state variables
   - Toast functionality not properly imported
   - Product updating logic needs to handle null values

2. Some **toast implementations** in the cart page and other pages need to be updated to use the correct format:
   - Changed from `toast.error(...)` to `toast({ title: "Error", ... })`

3. There may be **other pages** still using Supabase that weren't addressed in this session

## Next Steps

1. Follow the instructions in `SUPABASE_CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to fix the remaining issues
2. Run the batch script to remove all Supabase files that are no longer needed
3. Test the entire application to ensure it works without Supabase
4. Update package.json to remove Supabase dependencies

To fully complete the migration, you'll also need to:

1. Review and update any remaining pages that may be using Supabase
2. Test the entire application flow from registration to booking
3. Remove all Supabase dependencies from package.json
4. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to update your node_modules

This completes the major part of removing Supabase dependency from the Mountain Gear Rental application, replacing it with a localStorage-based system for authentication, products, and bookings.
